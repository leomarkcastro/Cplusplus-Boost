# Cplusplus-Boost

Cplusplus boost is a tool script written in C++ I made to be able to do more amazing things in a Microsoft Console like going to certain text location, changing background and text color and etc.

To Run anything here, you should have the "cppboost.cpp" in the same folder as the script
