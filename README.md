# Cplusplus-Boost

Cplusplus boost is a tool script written in C++ I made to be able to do more amazing things in a Microsoft Console like going to certain text location, changing background and text color and etc.

To Run anything here, you should have the "cppboost.cpp" in the same folder as the script

* Bacteria.cpp - My attempt to emulate a bacteria growth in a disc
* Key Input - Me trying to do asynchronous input from keyboard
* Maze Solver - Two points spawned at random points. Point A will try to find a path to point B
* Paint CPP - A colored painting in Microsoft Console
* Ping Pong - Ping Pong on console
* Snek - A fast paced colored snake game in a console
* Circle - A random project, (press space to throw a character) (it will ask you where direction to throw it)

* cppboost.cpp - THE BRAIN CHILD OF CONSOLE GRAPHICS USED BY ALL THESE SCRIPTS.
